<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in India and grew up and did my schooling from different cities across India. I am very much into 
  Cricket and Books. In my free time, I love to play or read Novels/Story book. I also love to travel and have 
  travelled to a lot of Indian Cities and States.</p>

<p>Working at Deloitte as a DevOps resource I have gained experience on multiple market DevOps tools such as 
  Azure DevOps, Copado, Jenkins, Github, Bitbucket. My work resolves around taking care of day to day deployments 
  to different testing environments and managing minor and major Production releases. I have also gained experience 
  in configuring CI/CD delta deployment pipelines using bash and shell scripting reducing the deployment time by 
  nearly 50%. I also have knowledge of many other DevOps tools and DevOps concepts like Virtualization, Vagrant, 
  Linux, Containerization, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS etc.</p>

<p>I am very interested in Web Development and currently on the path to learn complete Web Devlopment and also
  build my career around it as it is my passion and I have a lot of fun doing it.</p>
